  The PCI Bus driver and PCI Host Bridge Resource Allocation Protocol drivers

  PCI device, regarding the PCI enumeration.

  The GetDevicePolicy() function retrieves the platform policy for a particular
  component regarding PCI enumeration. The PCI bus driver and the PCI Host Bridge

  the policy.

  determines the supported attributes that are returned by the
  EFI_PCI_IO_PROTOCOL.Attributes() function.

  compliant features which would be supported by the PCI Bus driver in future;
  like for example the MPS, MRRS, Extended Tag, ASPM, etc. The details about
  this PCI features can be obtained from the PCI Base Specification 4.x. The
  EFI encodings for these feature are defined in the
  EFI_PCI_PLATFORM_EXTENDED_POLICY, see the Related Definition section for this.
  This member function will use the associated EFI handle of the PCI IO Protocol
